# glsl-snippets


When writing shaders I often come back to the same building blocks over and over again.

I wanted a place where I could easily find the building blocks as well as where I found them in order to give attribution to the original author.

My own building blocks I have created are all under CC0 which means I relinquishes copyright claims. Do whatever you want.
